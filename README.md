> GitHub Copilot uses the OpenAI Codex to suggest code and entire functions in real-time, right from your editor.

## OpenAI

### API
OpenAI has an API that lets you invoke pretrained text and image generation models as a web service:

[https://openai.com/api/](https://openai.com/api/)

> Access GPT-3, which performs a variety of natural language tasks, Codex, which translates natural language to code, and DALL·E, which creates and edits original images.

They charge for their API but you can get $18 in free credit when you sign up

### CLIP

CLIP can run on your machine and can be used as a "zero-shot" image classifier:

[https://github.com/openai/CLIP](https://github.com/openai/CLIP)

> CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training) is a neural network trained on a variety of (image, text) pairs. It can be instructed in natural language to predict the most relevant text snippet, given an image, without directly optimizing for the task, similarly to the zero-shot capabilities of GPT-2 and 3. We found CLIP matches the performance of the original ResNet50 on ImageNet “zero-shot” without using any of the original 1.28M labeled examples, overcoming several major challenges in computer vision.



## Huggingface

You can use pretrained models via a web service:

[https://huggingface.co/docs/api-inference/index](https://huggingface.co/docs/api-inference/index)

> Test and evaluate, for free, over 80,000 publicly accessible machine learning models, or your own private models, via simple HTTP requests, with fast inference hosted on Hugging Face shared infrastructure.

You can also download models to your machine and use them "offline."
